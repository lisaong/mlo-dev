# Banded Matrix Multiplication in CUDA
Create a function that implements matrix multiplication between a banded matrix and a dense matrix.

Matrix multiplication is often shown as `T0 += T1 * T2`, where T0, T1 and T2 are dense matrices. This is almost identical, except that the A matrix in this case, is a banded matrix.

This can be described as follows:

![banded_matmul](img/banded_matmul.png)

* n0 is the number of rows in T0 and T1
* n1 is the number of columns in T0 and T2
* n2 is the inner or shared dimension, i.e. number of columns in T1 and number of rows in T2

The matrix T1 is a banded matrix, a type of sparse matrix. It’s often given the form T1 on the left to save space in RAM, but logically represents Ť1 on the right.

(See [Band matrix - Wikipedia]() if you want more info. Banded matrices have interesting mathematical properties that make them very useful in special situations. But we won’t get into that here).

## Requirements

### Create a program that implements the following:

Matrix multiplication between a banded matrix and a dense matrix. The only size to consider is when T0 is 1024 rows by 1024 columns (i.e. n0 == n1 == 1024.).

### Measure your performance:

Run your function until 10 sec has passed, then count the number of iterations.

Print your performance in FLOPS, calculated by:

FLOPS = NumberOfIterations x NumberOfOps / ElapsedTimeInSec

Let’s assume the dense theorical number of ops, which would make NumberOfOps = 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 2.
Use 32-bit floating point data types for the input and output matrices.

In mathematics, particularly matrix theory, a band matrix or banded matrix is a sparse matrix whose non-zero entries are confined to a diagonal band, comprising the main diagonal and zero or more diagonals.
